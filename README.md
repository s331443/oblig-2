# oblig-2
#For this assignment I will try to estimate stock price using polynomial regression algorithm. 
#The reason I chose to use regression is because it is a good starting point and because this is my first time using ML.
#Since the stock price varies, the regression will try to find the best fit line which can predict the output.
#The variable Y can be calculated from a regression model of input variables X.
